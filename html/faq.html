      <span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span>
      How do I know you would hold in strict confidence any information I
      would share with you and not get into any conflict-of-interest situations that could potentially jeopardize my
      organization?
      <br><br>
      <span class="answer"><b>A:</b></span>
      BPC’s owner and president, Glenn Love, and any associate consultants who
      work on BPC projects, are required to sign the Engagement Agreement which contains a very strict confidentiality
      clause, as well as a conflict-of-interest avoidance clause. BPC works hard to gain your trust, and thus take
      these issues extremely seriously in order to maintain your trust.

      <span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span> How much are your fees?
      <br><br>
      <span class="answer"><b>A:</b></span>
      That depends on the scope and depth of the work we do, the size of your
      organization, the number of employees you have, the complexity of the project, and a variety other factors that
      must be considered. Before any work is done, the work required is carefully defined and put in writing,
      all phases of the project are outlined in writing, and the fee to be charged for each phase is provided.
      There are no surprises and no undisclosed add-ons (i.e., no “change orders) without prior discussion and prior
      written consent from the client.

      <span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span> Do you have any past clients I can talk to about the work you did with them?
      <br><br>
      <span class="answer"><b>A:</b></span>
      Absolutely. Once we identify the specifics needs you have, the scope the project, and you
      are ready to move forward, I will personally introduce you to some our past clients who grant
      me permission to do so.

      <span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span> Do you serve clients only in the Charlotte area?
      <br><br>
      <span class="answer"><b>A:</b></span>
      No. While our primary service area is Charlotte and both Carolinas, we have worked with
      leaders in 15 others states, plus the Bahamas.
      <br><br>

      <br>
      <span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span> What if we get started on a project together and have to delay it or cancel it for some
      reason, is that a problem?
      <br><br>
      <span class="answer"><b>A:</b></span>
      Not at all. All of our projects consist of pre-defined phases, so if we need to pause some
      work we are doing, or cancel the project for any reason, we will wrap up the current phase
      and hope to resume working with you at some point in the future.
      <br><br>

      <br>
      <span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span> Do you require that any expenses you have related to the project be reimbursed to BPC by
      your clients?
      <br><br>
      <span class="answer"><b>A:</b></span>
      Yes. Expenses could include any necessary travel such as airfare, rental vehicle, hotel
      accommodations, meals auto mileage to and from project locations, and photo copies, as
      needed.
