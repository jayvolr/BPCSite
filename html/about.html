      <h2>Why does Big Picture Consulting exist?</h2>

      We exist to serve leaders.
      <br><br>
      Maybe you or someone you know has some great ideas, but you're not quite sure how to define and
      implement them.
      <br><br>
      Maybe you have a big vision with big goals and need help prioritizing and communicating them to
      your leadership team. Or maybe you need help getting a vision and setting goals for you and your
      organization.
      <br><br>
      Maybe you can’t quite see the forest because of all the trees. Maybe you can't get a clear view of the
      horizon because of the intense wind and waves raging all around you. Or maybe you could use a
      lighthouse to help you navigate the treacherous seas and rocky shores of business ownership.
