      <h2>The Big Picture Assessment</h2>

      is a full-scope assessment of your organization , an “MRI” if you will, that analyzes 6 specific areas of leadership discipline. It is a
      comprehensive evaluation of your management and leadership practices including financial disciplines, operations, the
      organizational structure, and the work culture you have created The assessment takes place inside your business, is
      100% confidential, and concludes with a private meeting to review the findings and recommended actions. The BPA is
      fixed-fee service in which the fee charged is based on the size of the organization, the depth of the assessment needed,
      and the estimated time to complete.

      <h3>Questions we will seek answers to in the BPA Include:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Is your revenue growing?</li>
        <li>Are your expense control systems working properly?</li>
        <li>Is your profit increasing?</li>
        <li>Do you have the right people and are they in the right places doing the right things?</li>
        <li>How effective are your at communications and sharing your vision, both inside and outside the organization?</li>
        <li>How is your employee productivity?</li>
        <li>Where are you right now?</li>
        <li>Where are you going?</li>
        <li>And why?</li>
      </ul>

      The Big Picture Assessment examines your organization’s entire terrain including:
      revenue growth trends, expense controls, and bottom-line profitability, to operating efficiencies, employee productivity,
      communications, and policies and procedures. The assessment takes anywhere from one to five days, and involves an
      analysis of data you provide (data that never leaves your business), confidential surveys of your staff , and one-on- one
      meetings with the CEO, the management team, and a cross-section of your employees. The assessment concludes with a
      private meeting in which findings are presented along with recommendations for improvement.

      <h3>What can we possibly show you that you don’t already know?</h3>

      Not everything is easily seen. Deadlines, stress and just the huge responsibilities of overseeing and running an
      organization can obstruct your view. The Big Picture Assessment is designed to help you get above it all – to get a
      “satellite view”of your business. It’s hard to see it all from the ground.
