      <span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span>
      How do I know you would hold in strict confidence any information I
      would share with you and not get into any conflict-of-interest situations that could potentially jeopardize my
      organization?
      <br><br>
      <span class="answer"><b>A:</b></span>
      BPC’s owner and president, Glenn Love, and any associate consultants who
      work on BPC projects, are required to sign the Engagement Agreement which contains a very strict confidentiality
      clause, as well as a conflict-of-interest avoidance clause. BPC works hard to gain your trust, and thus take
      these issues extremely seriously in order to maintain your trust.

      <span class="question"><b>Q:</b></span> How much are your fees?
      <br><br>
      <span class="answer"><b>A:</b></span>
      That depends on the scope and depth of the work we do, the size of your
      organization, the number of employees you have, the complexity of the project, and a variety other factors that
      must be considered. Before any work is done, the work required is carefully defined and put in writing,
      all phases of the project are outlined in writing, and the fee to be charged for each phase is provided.
      There are no surprises and no undisclosed add-ons (i.e., no “change orders) without prior discussion and prior
      written consent from the client.
